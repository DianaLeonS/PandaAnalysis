The author feels the need to amend the license: a user of the Software agrees
not to complain to the author in the event that the Software does not reproduce
what is in the user's head. The Software was written to serve the analysis 
interests of the author and does so very well; any other usage is at-your-own-risk.
Do not open issues and definitely do not assign them to the author. Open pull 
requests, and they will be merged if they do not conflict with the author's physics 
goals.
